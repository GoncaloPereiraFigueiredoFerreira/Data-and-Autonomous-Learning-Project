# Data and Automated Learning Project

Project developed in the DAA course, it involved the training and testing of multiple machine learning models, to solve 2 diferent problems.

The first problem was the "Prediction of Heart Attacks" based on a dataset that containned multiple data points from diferent people with diferent health conditions. The main objective was to filter out the un-correlated information to the probability of having a heart attack.

The second problem was part of a Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sbstpdaa2223] competion and its main objective was to predict the level of incidents that happened in a given day in the portuguese city of Guimar√£es, according to diferent datapoints related to weather and trafic conditions. We ended up placing second in the final testing, with a very close accuracy score, and placing first in the public scoring system.

Final Grade: 18.6/20
